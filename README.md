setup-script
============

This is the script I run after a fresh linux install on my desktop.

Upgrading my Desktop
--------------------

1. The setup of my desktop is one hard drive for operating systems and one for data. At any given time I usually have one linux partition and a windows partition along with some free space. Install the new version of linux to the free space and then grow the partition after I'm happy with the new setup. This lets me copy old config over directly in addition to this script.

2. Download the script and run it. Rememeber that it requires an enter press to continue with each step. I usually take a second to update the versions of some of the items as well.
